# ✅ DAILY TRADING CHECKLIST

*(Using the System Correctly)*

---

## 🌅 MORNING / PRE-MARKET (10 minutes)

☐ Run the trading system **once**
☐ Generate today’s decisions (Buy / No Trade / Exit)
☐ Read the system’s reason for each decision

❌ Do NOT add your own opinion
❌ Do NOT look for extra confirmation

👉 If the system says **NO TRADE**, you are DONE for the day.

---

## 📊 MARKET HOURS (Optional – Observe Only)

☐ Observe price movement of approved trades
☐ Observe rejected stocks (only to learn later)

❌ Do NOT change decisions
❌ Do NOT enter late
❌ Do NOT chase moving stocks

👉 Observation only. No action.

---

## 🌙 POST-MARKET (10–15 minutes)

☐ Record what happened (facts only)
☐ Note entries, exits, or no-trade day
☐ Record system confidence for trades
☐ Save system output/log

❌ No emotions
❌ No “I should have” thoughts

---

## 🧠 QUICK SELF-CHECK (VERY IMPORTANT)

Answer **YES or NO**:

☐ Did I follow the system exactly today?
☐ Did I avoid overriding decisions?
☐ Did I accept a no-trade day calmly?

If **any answer is NO** → note it and stop trading tomorrow.

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS — STOP IMMEDIATELY IF YOU FEEL:

☐ Urge to trade despite NO TRADE signal
☐ Desire to increase position size
☐ Frustration from missing a move
☐ Impulse to tweak rules today

👉 These mean **emotion is trying to take control**.

---

## 🟡 WEEKLY MINI-REVIEW (Once a Week Only)

☐ Count number of trade days vs no-trade days
☐ Check if losses stayed small
☐ Review system explanations
☐ Identify repeating mistakes (if any)

❌ Do NOT make daily changes
❌ Do NOT chase performance

---

## 🔒 NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (PIN THIS)

✔ The system decides
✔ Doing nothing is a valid outcome
✔ Losses are part of the process
✔ Boredom = discipline
✔ Consistency beats excitement

---

## 🏁 END-OF-DAY STATEMENT (Say This)

> **“I followed the system today.
> My job is done.”**
